    `Dr. Harpreet Singh Grewal, Associate Professor, Department of Mechanical Engineering, has featured in the list of the top 2% of scientists in the world. Stanford University has released the list that identifies the top 2% of the most-cited scientists in various disciplines. Dr. Grewal has been included in the list of scientists who have excelled in research in the fields of Mechanical Engineering. The list, released on October 19, was created by Stanford experts on the basis of standardized citation indicators like information on citations, h-index, co-authorship, and a composite indicator last year. Dr. Grewal’s research interests include developing bio-inspired superhydrophobic self-cleaning metallic and polymer surfaces with tuned wetting, adhesion, and frictional properties.  Further, he is also involved in surface modifications for controlling wear, and corrosion using techniques such as thermal spraying, microwave processing, and friction stir processing. He has published more than 80 peer-reviewed International Journal papers, several national/International conference papers, patents, and sponsored projects from DST-SERB, NRB, and CSIR.`,

    `Team Vidyut i s a team of 9 members under the guidance of D r. Nishant Mishra. This year we had an i nteresting problem statement i n which we had to build a robot which would harness wind and solar energy and transport weights from one location to another. The tricky part of the problem statement was that w e were not allowed to use any battery other than a small AAA cell used in TV remotes to store the harnessed energy. Throughout the period of 6 months, we have gone through extensive prototyping processes to adequately address the SDC challenge statement. We had to think of a storage method which would not involve any type of chemical reactions.`];
